Hello! Iâ€™m a Data Science Professional with a solid foundation of 2 years as a Business Analyst, where Iâ€™ve specialized in delivering impactful data insights to senior leadership and guiding data-driven decisions across dynamic industries. With expertise in SQL, Python, and Tableau, and an MS in Data Science, I excel in data preprocessing, visualization, and applying machine learning algorithms to turn complex datasets into actionable insights. Iâ€™m also skilled at managing cross-functional projects and effectively communicating data insights to non-technical stakeholders.

## Projects ðŸ¤“

### Lyric Analyzer and Generation | Python, LLM, Transformer, Streamlit [github](https://github.com/upmanyu1993/Final_Project_Group5)

- Developed a web app using Streamlit for Artist-specific Lyric Generation & Lyric Analysis.
- Fine-tuned GPT-2 model for lyrics generation, and trained on the lyrics from top artists.
- Built a lyrics analyzer (Lyric Summarization, Keyword Extraction,...) using transformer models including BERT and BART.

### Heart Disease Analysis and Prediction | Python, Binary Classification, Statistical Modeling [github](https://github.com/orangekim28/FinalProject-Group8)

- Applied machine learning algorithms to the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset to predict heart disease likelihood.
- Focused on data cleaning, feature selection, and identifying key health indicators impacting heart disease risk.
- Handled imbalanced binary classification data with the SMOTE oversampling method.
- Developed statistical prediction models including MLP, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest with the best F1 macro score of 0.8.

### Metro Traffic Volume Analysis and Prediction | Python, Time Series, SARIMA, LSTM [github](https://github.com/jiwoosuh/MetroTrafficVolume)

- Developed a time-series model to predict traffic volume on I-94 in Minneapolis-St Paul using multivariate data, including weather and holidays.
- Handled the missing value in hourly traffic volume data with various methods such as interpolation and data resampling.
- Built ARIMA, SARIMA, OLS model, and LSTM model to predict the traffic volume. 
- Evaluated models based on RMSE, analyzed seasonality, and provided insights to enhance urban planning and reduce congestion.
